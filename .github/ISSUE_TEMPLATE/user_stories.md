**User story**
<!--
A user story is a description of a feature,
from the perspective of the user who desires it.
We appreciate all user stories that as long or short,
simple or detailed, as you like!
They typically follow a template like the below.

An example:

As an *infrequent user of MDAnalysis*,
I want to *easily know what the units of MDAnalysis are*,
so that *I don't accidentally mix up units in my analyses*.

-->

As a *[type of user]*, I want to *[some goal]*,
so that *[reason why]*.

**Additional context**

<!--
If there's any current documentation addressing similar issues
and why it doesn't solve the problem,
or any other additional context
