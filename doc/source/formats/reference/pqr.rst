=============================
PQR file (PDB2PQR / APBS)
=============================

.. include:: classes/PQR.txt

MDAnalysis can read classes from a PQR_ file (as written by PDB2PQR_). Parsing is adopted from the description of the PQR_ format as used by APBS_.

.. Warning:: Fields *must be white-space separated* or data are read
             incorrectly. PDB formatted files are *not* guaranteed to be
             white-space separated so extra care should be taken when quickly
             converting PDB files into PQR files using simple scripts.

For example, PQR files created with PDB2PQR_ and the `--whitespace`
option are guaranteed to conform to the above format::

   pdb2pqr --ff=charmm --whitespace 4ake.pdb 4ake.pqr

Reading in
==========

MDAnalysis reads data on a per-line basis from PQR files using the following format::

   recordName serial atomName residueName chainID residueNumber X Y Z charge radius

If this fails it is assumed that the *chainID* was omitted and the shorter
format is read::

   recordName serial atomName residueName residueNumber X Y Z charge radius

Anything else will raise a :exc:`ValueError`.

The whitespace is the most important feature of this format: fields
*must* be separated by at least one space or tab character.


Writing out
===========

Charges ("Q") are taken from the :attr:`MDAnalysis.core.groups.Atom.charge` attribute while radii are obtained from the :attr:`MDAnalysis.core.groups.Atom.radius` attribute.

    * If the segid is 'SYSTEM' then it will be set to the empty string. Otherwise the first letter will be used as the chain ID.
    * The serial number always starts at 1 and increments sequentially for the atoms.

The output format is similar to ``pdb2pqr --whitespace``.

Output should look like this (although the only real requirement is
*whitespace* separation between *all* entries). The chainID is optional
and can be omitted::

  ATOM      1  N    MET     1     -11.921   26.307   10.410 -0.3000 1.8500
  ATOM     36  NH1  ARG     2      -6.545   25.499    3.854 -0.8000 1.8500
  ATOM     37 HH11  ARG     2      -6.042   25.480    4.723  0.4600 0.2245



PQR specification
=================

The PQR fields read are:

.. glossary::

    recordName
        A string which specifies the type of PQR entry and should either be ATOM or
        HETATM.

    serial
        An integer which provides the atom index (but note that MDAnalysis renumbers
        atoms so one cannot rely on the *serial*)

    atomName
        A string which provides the atom name.

    residueName
        A string which provides the residue name.

    chainID
        An optional string which provides the chain ID of the atom.

    residueNumber
        An integer which provides the residue index.

    X Y Z
        Three floats which provide the atomic coordiantes.

    charge
        A float which provides the atomic charge (in electrons).

    radius
        A float which provides the atomic radius (in Ã…).

Clearly, this format can deviate wildly from PDB_ due to the use of whitespaces
rather than specific column widths and alignments. This deviation can be
particularly significant when large coordinate values are used.
