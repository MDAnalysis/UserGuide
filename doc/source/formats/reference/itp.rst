ITP (GROMACS portable topology files)

A ITP_ file is a portable topology file.

.. important::

    Unlike :ref:`TPR <TPR-format>` files, atom ``ids`` and residues ``resids`` in ITP files are indexed from 1. This means that a TPR file created from your ITP files will have *different* numbering in MDAnalysis than the ITP file.
