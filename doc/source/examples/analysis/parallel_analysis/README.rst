How to run your analysis parallelly
*********************************************************

As we approach the exascale barrier, researchers are handling increasingly 	
large volumes of molecular dynamics (MD) data. Whilst MDAnalysis is a flexible	
and relatively fast framework for complex analysis tasks in MD simulations, 	
implementing a parallel computing framework would play a pivotal role in 	
accelerating the time to solution for such large datasets.	

This document illustrates how you can run your own analysis
script parallelly with MDAnalysis.
