Groups
====================


For convenience, chemically meaningful groups of Atoms such as a 
Residue or a Segment (typically a whole molecule or all of the solvent) 
also exist as containers, as well as groups of these units (
ResidueGroup, SegmentGroup).

AtomGroups
==========
AtomGroup instances can be easily created 
(e.g., from an AtomGroup.select_atoms() selection or simply by slicing).
