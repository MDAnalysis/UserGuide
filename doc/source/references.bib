	abstract = {Protein folding is considered here by studying the dynamics of the folding of the triple β-strand WW domain from the Formin binding protein 28 (FBP). Starting from the unfolded state and ending either in the native or nonnative conformational states, trajectories are generated with the coarse-grained united residue (UNRES) force field. The effectiveness of principal component analysis (PCA), an already-established mathematical technique for finding global, correlated motions in atomic simulations of proteins, is evaluated here for coarse-grained trajectories. The problems related to PCA and their solutions are discussed. The folding and non-folding of proteins are examined with free energy landscapes. Detailed analyses of many folding and non-folding trajectories at different temperatures show that PCA is very efficient for characterizing the general folding and non-folding features of proteins. It is shown that the first principal component captures and describes in detail the dynamics of a system. Anomalous diffusion in the folding/non-folding dynamics is examined by the mean-square displacement, (MSD), and the fractional diffusion and fractional kinetic equations. The collision-less (or ballistic) behavior of a polypeptide undergoing Brownian motion along the first few principal components is accounted for.},

	abstract = {Abstract Helical conformations of infinite polymer chains may be described by the helical parameters, d and θ (the translation along the helix axis and the angle of rotation about the axis per repeat unit), pi (the distance of the ith atom from the axis), dij, and dij (the translation along the axis and the angle of rotation, respectively, on passing from the ith atom to the jth). A general method has been worked out for calculating all those helical parameters from the bond lengths, bond angles, and internal-rotation angles. The positions of the main chain and side chain atoms with respect to the axis may also be calculated. All the equations are applicable to any helical polymer chain and are readily programmed for electronic computers. A method is also presented for calculating the partial derivatives of helical parameters with respect to molecular parameters.},
