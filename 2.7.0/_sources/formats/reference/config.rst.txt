MDAnalysis can read information both from DL Poly_ config and DL Poly history files. Although DL Poly input file units can be flexible, output files appear to have the following units:

    - Time: ps
    - Length: Angstrom
    - Mass: amu (Dalton)
    - Velocity: Angstrom/ps
    - Force: Angstrom Dalton / ps :sup:`2`

MDAnalysis currently does not convert these into the native kJ/(mol A) force units when reading files in. See `Issue 2393`_ for discussion on units.
